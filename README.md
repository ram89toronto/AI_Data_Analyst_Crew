Autonomous CSV Data Analyst Crew
This project uses CrewAI to create an autonomous team of AI agents that perform a complete data analysis pipeline on any CSV file.

You provide a CSV, and the crew will automatically:

Ingest & Clean the data.

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Generate Visualizations (as PNG files).

Write a final Markdown Report with key insights and actionable recommendations.

⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING: REMOVE YOUR API KEY

Your code contains a hardcoded OPENAI_API_KEY. Do not commit this file to GitHub or share it. Anyone who sees it can use your key and spend your money.

You must remove it and use a .env file instead. The instructions below show you exactly how to do this.

Architecture: The Analyst Crew
The project works using a hierarchical CrewAI setup. A manager agent plans and delegates tasks to a team of specialists:

Analytics Manager: The team lead. It reviews the goal, delegates tasks in order (Ingestion -> EDA -> Viz -> Insights), verifies the output of each step, and requests fixes if files are missing or malformed.

Data Ingestion & Cleaning Engineer: Loads the raw CSV, cleans column names, handles missing values (NA), flags outliers, and saves the cleaned data as df_cleaned.pkl and a schema.json.

EDA Specialist: Analyzes the cleaned data to find descriptive stats, correlations, and distributions. It outputs an eda_summary.json that includes a list of candidate_plots for the next agent.

Visualization Engineer: Reads the candidate_plots list and generates the actual PNG plots (e.g., histograms, bar charts, line plots) using Matplotlib. It saves them to the /out/figs directory and creates a figs_index.json with captions.

Insights & Strategy Analyst: The final agent. It reads all the JSON artifacts and the figure index to write a comprehensive report.md. This report is designed for an executive, including an overview, data quality notes, top 3-5 insights, and concrete next actions.

Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git
cd your-project-name
Create a requirements.txt file: Create a file named requirements.txt and add the dependencies from your script:

crewai
crewai[tools]
pandas
matplotlib
python-dotenv
Install dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your Environment (The Security Fix):

Create a file named .env in the same directory.

Add your API key to this file:

Ini, TOML

OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-Your-Actual-API-Key-Goes-Here"
Modify your Python script to load this key securely. Replace the "Configuration API Keys" section with this:

Python

# ----------------------------------------------------
# NEW CODE (Secure)
# ----------------------------------------------------
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

# Now, os.environ will have the key if your .env file is set up
assert "OPENAI_API_KEY" in os.environ, "OPENAI_API_KEY not found. Please create a .env file with your key."

# ----------------------------------------------------
# OLD CODE TO REMOVE (Insecure)
# ----------------------------------------------------
# os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-proj-VBnH4XuNX7M18q8zO..."
# ----------------------------------------------------
Usage
Add Your Data: Place your CSV file in the root of the project directory (e.g., Final_data.csv).

Check the Runner: Make sure the last line of your Python script points to your CSV file:

Python

# To Initiate the AI Analyst upload the path of CSV and run the below code
run_analytics(csv_path="Final_data.csv")
Run the Crew:

Bash

python your-script-name.py
Expected Outputs
After the script finishes, check the out/ directory. You will find all the artifacts generated by the crew:

out/df_cleaned.pkl: The cleaned DataFrame, ready for further analysis.

out/schema.json: A JSON file detailing column types, NA handling, and other cleaning decisions.

out/eda_summary.json: A JSON file with statistical highlights and candidate plot suggestions.

out/figs/: A directory containing all generated Matplotlib plots as PNG files (e.g., fig_01.png, fig_02.png).

out/figs_index.json: A JSON file listing the generated figures and their captions.

out/report.md: The final analysis report in Markdown format, complete with insights and recommendations.
